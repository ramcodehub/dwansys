# Netlify Configuration Fix v2 - Correcting Base Directory Path

## Problem
The Netlify deployment was failing with the following error:
```
npm error path /opt/build/repo/frontend/package.json
npm error enoent Could not read package.json: Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '/opt/build/repo/frontend/package.json'
```

## Root Cause
The Netlify configuration was incorrectly pointing to the wrong base directory. The configuration had:
```toml
[build]
  base = "frontend"
  command = "npm run build"
  publish = "frontend/dist"
```

However, the actual project structure is:
```
repo/
└── frontend/
    └── frontend/          <- This is where package.json actually is
        ├── package.json
        ├── dist/          <- This is where the build output goes
        └── src/
```

## Solution Applied
Updated both [netlify.toml](file://c:\Users\sathi\OneDrive\Desktop\Dwansys\frontend\netlify.toml) files (root and frontend directory) to correctly point to the actual location of the frontend project:

```toml
[build]
  base = "frontend/frontend"
  command = "npm run build"
  publish = "frontend/frontend/dist"
```

## Verification
- Configuration files now point to the correct directory where [package.json](file://c:\Users\sathi\OneDrive\Desktop\Dwansys\frontend\frontend\frontend\package.json) exists
- Build command should now be able to find and execute npm scripts
- Publish directory correctly points to the build output location

## Next Steps
1. Commit these changes to the repository
2. Push to trigger a new Netlify build
3. Monitor the deployment to ensure it completes successfully
