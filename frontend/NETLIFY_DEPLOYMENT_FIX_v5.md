# üõ†Ô∏è Netlify Deployment Fix Summary (Version 5)

This document summarizes the fixes applied to resolve the Netlify deployment error related to image path resolution.

## üìã Issue Description
The Netlify deployment was failing with the following error:
```
Could not resolve "../../assets/images/DWAN Architecture.png" from "src/pages/Home/Home.jsx"
```

## üîç Root Cause Analysis
The issue was caused by a **file name case mismatch** between the import statement and the actual file name. This is a common problem when developing on Windows (case-insensitive) and deploying to Linux-based platforms like Netlify (case-sensitive).

Specifically:
- Import statement: `../../assets/images/DWAN Architecture.png` (uppercase "DWAN")
- Actual file name: `Dwan Architecture.png` (title case "Dwan")

## üõ†Ô∏è Fixes Applied

### 1. Image Import Path Correction
Updated the import statement in `src/pages/Home/Home.jsx` to match the actual file name:

**Before:**
```javascript
import DWANArchitecture from '../../assets/images/DWAN Architecture.png';
```

**After:**
```javascript
import DWANArchitecture from '../../assets/images/Dwan Architecture.png';
```

### 2. Verification
Successfully ran a local build to verify the fix:
```bash
cd frontend
npm run build
```
The build completed successfully with no errors, and the "Dwan Architecture-QjYxv_d9.png" file was properly processed.
