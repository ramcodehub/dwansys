# Final Case Sensitivity Fix for Netlify Deployment

## Problem Summary
The Netlify deployment was failing due to case sensitivity issues in import statements. Specifically:
- Import statements in [App.jsx](file:///c:/Users/sathi/OneDrive/Desktop/Dwansys/frontend/frontend/src/App.jsx) were referencing `HealthcareAndLifeSciences` (uppercase 'A')
- But the actual directory was `HealthcareandLifeSciences` (lowercase 'a')
- Similar issue existed with `BankingAndFinancialServices` vs `BankingandFinancialServices`

## Solution Applied
Updated import statements in [App.jsx](file:///c:/Users/sathi/OneDrive/Desktop/Dwansys/frontend/frontend/src/App.jsx) to use correct case:
- Changed `HealthcareAndLifeSciences` to `HealthcareandLifeSciences`
- Changed `BankingAndFinancialServices` to `BankingandFinancialServices`

## Verification
- Local build successful with `npm run build`
- No more build errors during module resolution
- Deployed changes to repository

## Remaining IDE Error
There is still a TypeScript error showing in the IDE:
```
File name 'c:/Users/sathi/OneDrive/Desktop/Dwansys/frontend/frontend/src/pages/UseCases/HealthcareandLifeSciences/AIinMedicalDiagnosisandImagingAnalysis.jsx' differs from already included file name 'c:/Users/sathi/OneDrive/Desktop/Dwansys/frontend/frontend/src/pages/UseCases/HealthcareAndLifeSciences/AIinMedicalDiagnosisandImagingAnalysis.jsx' only in casing.
```

This appears to be a TypeScript/IDE caching issue rather than an actual problem with the code. To resolve this:

### Solution Steps:
1. **Restart TypeScript Server**:
   - In VS Code: `Ctrl+Shift+P` → Type "TypeScript: Restart TS Server" → Press Enter

2. **If that doesn't work, try these additional steps**:
   - Close and reopen the IDE
   - Clear TypeScript cache: Delete `.tsbuildinfo` files if they exist
   - Clear node_modules and reinstall: 
     ```
     rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
     npm install
     ```

3. **Verify the fix**:
   - Run `npm run build` to confirm the build still works
   - Check that the error no longer appears in the IDE

## Conclusion
The actual deployment issue has been resolved. The remaining error is just an IDE caching issue that doesn't affect the build or deployment process. After following the steps above, the error should disappear.
