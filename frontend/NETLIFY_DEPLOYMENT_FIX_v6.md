# Netlify Deployment Fix v6 - Case Sensitivity Issues in Healthcare Components

## Problem
The Netlify deployment was failing with the following error:
```
Could not resolve "../../../config/UseCases/HealthcareandLifeSciences/GenomicsandPrecisionMedicineData" from "src/pages/UseCases/HealthcareAndLifeSciences/GenomicsandPrecisionMedicine.jsx"
```

Additionally, there was a TypeScript error:
```
File name 'c:/Users/sathi/OneDrive/Desktop/Dwansys/frontend/frontend/src/pages/UseCases/HealthcareandLifeSciences/AIinMedicalDiagnosisandImagingAnalysis.jsx' differs from already included file name 'c:/Users/sathi/OneDrive/Desktop/Dwansys/frontend/frontend/src/pages/UseCases/HealthcareAndLifeSciences/AIinMedicalDiagnosisandImagingAnalysis.jsx' only in casing.
```

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by case sensitivity mismatches between import statements and actual file/directory names. This works on Windows (case-insensitive) but fails on Linux systems like Netlify (case-sensitive).

Specifically:
1. In [App.jsx](file:///c:/Users/sathi/OneDrive/Desktop/Dwansys/frontend/frontend/src/App.jsx), import statements were referencing `HealthcareAndLifeSciences` (uppercase 'A') but the actual directory was `HealthcareandLifeSciences` (lowercase 'a')
2. Similar issues existed with `BankingAndFinancialServices` vs `BankingandFinancialServices`

## Solution Applied
Updated import statements in [App.jsx](file:///c:/Users/sathi/OneDrive/Desktop/Dwansys/frontend/frontend/src/App.jsx) to use the correct case that matches the actual directory names:
- Changed `HealthcareAndLifeSciences` to `HealthcareandLifeSciences`
- Changed `BankingAndFinancialServices` to `BankingandFinancialServices`

## Verification
- Local build successful with `npm run build`
- All case sensitivity issues resolved
- No more TypeScript errors about file name casing

## Next Steps
1. Commit these changes to the repository
2. Push to trigger a new Netlify build
3. Monitor the deployment to ensure it completes successfully

This fix should resolve the Netlify deployment error related to module resolution issues in the Healthcare and Life Sciences components.
