# üìù Case Sensitivity Fixes Summary

This document summarizes all the case sensitivity issues that were fixed to resolve the Netlify deployment error.

## üîß Issues Fixed

### 1. Insurance Directory
**File**: [frontend/src/pages/UseCases/Insurance/PredictiveAnalyticsforClaimsManagement.jsx](file:///c:/Users/sathi/OneDrive/Desktop/Dwansys/frontend/src/pages/UseCases/Insurance/PredictiveAnalyticsforClaimsManagement.jsx)
**Issue**: Import path case mismatch
**Fix**: Changed `PredictiveAnalyticsforClaimsManagementData` to `PredictiveAnalyticsForClaimsManagementData`

### 2. Healthcare Directory
**File**: [frontend/src/pages/UseCases/HealthcareandLifeSciences/AIinMedicalDiagnosisandImagingAnalysis.jsx](file:///c:/Users/sathi/OneDrive/Desktop/Dwansys/frontend/src/pages/UseCases/HealthcareandLifeSciences/AIinMedicalDiagnosisandImagingAnalysis.jsx)
**Issue**: Directory name case mismatch
**Fix**: Changed `HealthcareAndLifeSciences` to `HealthcareandLifeSciences`

**File**: [frontend/src/pages/UseCases/HealthcareandLifeSciences/GenomicsandPrecisionMedicine.jsx](file:///c:/Users/sathi/OneDrive/Desktop/Dwansys/frontend/src/pages/UseCases/HealthcareandLifeSciences/GenomicsandPrecisionMedicine.jsx)
**Issue**: Directory name case mismatch
**Fix**: Changed `HealthcareAndLifeSciences` to `HealthcareandLifeSciences`

**File**: [frontend/src/pages/UseCases/HealthcareandLifeSciences/PredictiveAnalyticsforDiseaseOutbreaks.jsx](file:///c:/Users/sathi/OneDrive/Desktop/Dwansys/frontend/src/pages/UseCases/HealthcareandLifeSciences/PredictiveAnalyticsforDiseaseOutbreaks.jsx)
**Issue 1**: Directory name case mismatch
**Fix 1**: Changed `HealthcareAndLifeSciences` to `HealthcareandLifeSciences`
**Issue 2**: Extra space in variable reference
**Fix 2**: Removed space in `PredictiveAnalyticsForDiseaseOutbreaksData .sections`

**File**: [frontend/src/pages/UseCases/HealthcareandLifeSciences/AIinMentalHealth.jsx](file:///c:/Users/sathi/OneDrive/Desktop/Dwansys/frontend/src/pages/UseCases/HealthcareandLifeSciences/AIinMentalHealth.jsx)
**Issue**: Directory name case mismatch
**Fix**: Changed `HealthcareAndLifeSciences` to `HealthcareandLifeSciences`

## üìã Files Verified (No Issues Found)
- All other files in the Insurance directory
- All files in the BankingandFinancialServices directory
- All remaining files in the HealthcareandLifeSciences directory
- All files in the Sustainability directory

## üéØ Root Cause
The issue was caused by case sensitivity differences between Windows (development environment) and Linux (Netlify build environment). Windows is case-insensitive, while Linux is case-sensitive, causing import failures when file names don't match exactly.

## ‚úÖ Verification
After these fixes, the Netlify build should succeed as all import paths now exactly match the actual file names in the repository.

## üìù Note
This is a common issue when deploying JavaScript/React applications from Windows to Linux-based hosting platforms. Always ensure that import paths exactly match file names in terms of case sensitivity.
