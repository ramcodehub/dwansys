# üõ†Ô∏è Netlify Deployment Fix Summary

This document summarizes the fixes applied to resolve the Netlify deployment error.

## üìã Issue Description
The Netlify deployment was failing with the following error:
```
Could not resolve "../../../config/UseCases/Insurance/PredictiveAnalyticsforClaimsManagementData" from "src/pages/UseCases/Insurance/PredictiveAnalyticsforClaimsManagement.jsx"
```

## üîç Root Cause Analysis
The issue was caused by **case sensitivity mismatches** between import paths and actual file names. This is a common problem when developing on Windows (case-insensitive) and deploying to Linux-based platforms like Netlify (case-sensitive).

## üõ†Ô∏è Fixes Applied

### 1. Case Sensitivity Corrections
Fixed import paths in the following files to match exact file names:

1. **[frontend/src/pages/UseCases/Insurance/PredictiveAnalyticsforClaimsManagement.jsx](file:///c:/Users/sathi/OneDrive/Desktop/Dwansys/frontend/src/pages/UseCases/Insurance/PredictiveAnalyticsforClaimsManagement.jsx)**
   - Fixed: `PredictiveAnalyticsforClaimsManagementData` ‚Üí `PredictiveAnalyticsForClaimsManagementData`

2. **[frontend/src/pages/UseCases/HealthcareandLifeSciences/AIinMedicalDiagnosisandImagingAnalysis.jsx](file:///c:/Users/sathi/OneDrive/Desktop/Dwansys/frontend/src/pages/UseCases/HealthcareandLifeSciences/AIinMedicalDiagnosisandImagingAnalysis.jsx)**
   - Fixed: `HealthcareAndLifeSciences` ‚Üí `HealthcareandLifeSciences`

3. **[frontend/src/pages/UseCases/HealthcareandLifeSciences/GenomicsandPrecisionMedicine.jsx](file:///c:/Users/sathi/OneDrive/Desktop/Dwansys/frontend/src/pages/UseCases/HealthcareandLifeSciences/GenomicsandPrecisionMedicine.jsx)**
   - Fixed: `HealthcareAndLifeSciences` ‚Üí `HealthcareandLifeSciences`

4. **[frontend/src/pages/UseCases/HealthcareandLifeSciences/PredictiveAnalyticsforDiseaseOutbreaks.jsx](file:///c:/Users/sathi/OneDrive/Desktop/Dwansys/frontend/src/pages/UseCases/HealthcareandLifeSciences/PredictiveAnalyticsforDiseaseOutbreaks.jsx)**
   - Fixed: `HealthcareAndLifeSciences` ‚Üí `HealthcareandLifeSciences`
   - Fixed extra space in variable reference

5. **[frontend/src/pages/UseCases/HealthcareandLifeSciences/AIinMentalHealth.jsx](file:///c:/Users/sathi/OneDrive/Desktop/Dwansys/frontend/src/pages/UseCases/HealthcareandLifeSciences/AIinMentalHealth.jsx)**
   - Fixed: `HealthcareAndLifeSciences` ‚Üí `HealthcareandLifeSciences`

### 2. Verification
Successfully ran a local build to verify the fixes:
```bash
cd frontend
npm run build
```
The build completed successfully with no errors.

## üìù Additional Documentation Created

- **[DOMAIN_CONFIGURATION.md](file:///c:/Users/sathi/OneDrive/Desktop/Dwansys/DOMAIN_CONFIGURATION.md)** - Domain configuration for your specific domains
- **[DEPLOYMENT_VERIFICATION.md](file:///c:/Users/sathi/OneDrive/Desktop/Dwansys/DEPLOYMENT_VERIFICATION.md)** - Step-by-step verification guide

## ‚úÖ Next Steps
1. Commit these changes to your repository
2. Trigger a new Netlify deployment
3. Verify the deployment succeeds
4. Test your live site at https://dwansys.com/

## üéØ Expected Outcome
