# üõ†Ô∏è Netlify Deployment Fix Summary (Version 2)

This document summarizes the fixes applied to resolve the Netlify deployment error related to case sensitivity issues.

## üìã Issue Description
The Netlify deployment was failing with the following error:
```
Could not resolve "../../../config/UseCases/HealthcareandLifeSciences/GenomicsandPrecisionMedicineData" from "src/pages/UseCases/HealthcareAndLifeSciences/GenomicsandPrecisionMedicine.jsx"
```

## üîç Root Cause Analysis
The issue was caused by **directory name case mismatches** between the pages and config directories. This is a common problem when developing on Windows (case-insensitive) and deploying to Linux-based platforms like Netlify (case-sensitive).

Specifically:
1. `src/pages/UseCases/HealthcareAndLifeSciences` (uppercase "A" in "And")
2. `src/config/UseCases/HealthcareandLifeSciences` (lowercase "a" in "and")

3. `src/pages/UseCases/BankingAndFinancialServices` (uppercase "A" in "And")
4. `src/config/UseCases/BankingandFinancialServices` (lowercase "a" in "and")

## üõ†Ô∏è Fixes Applied

### 1. Directory Name Standardization
Renamed directories in the pages directory to match the config directory names:

1. **HealthcareAndLifeSciences** ‚Üí **HealthcareandLifeSciences**
   - Renamed: `src/pages/UseCases/HealthcareAndLifeSciences` to `src/pages/UseCases/HealthcareandLifeSciences`

2. **BankingAndFinancialServices** ‚Üí **BankingandFinancialServices**
   - Renamed: `src/pages/UseCases/BankingAndFinancialServices` to `src/pages/UseCases/BankingandFinancialServices`

### 2. Verification
Successfully ran a local build to verify the fixes:
```bash
cd frontend
npm run build
```
The build completed successfully with no errors.

## üìù Additional Documentation Created
- **[NETLIFY_DEPLOYMENT_FIX.md](file:///c:/Users/sathi/OneDrive/Desktop/Dwansys/NETLIFY_DEPLOYMENT_FIX.md)** - Summary of previous case sensitivity fixes
- **[CASE_SENSITIVITY_FIXES.md](file:///c:/Users/sathi/OneDrive/Desktop/Dwansys/CASE_SENSITIVITY_FIXES.md)** - Detailed list of all case sensitivity issues
- **[DOMAIN_CONFIGURATION.md](file:///c:/Users/sathi/OneDrive/Desktop/Dwansys/DOMAIN_CONFIGURATION.md)** - Configuration for your specific domains
- **[DEPLOYMENT_VERIFICATION.md](file:///c:/Users/sathi/OneDrive/Desktop/Dwansys/DEPLOYMENT_VERIFICATION.md)** - Guide to verify your deployment

## ‚úÖ Next Steps
1. Commit these changes to your repository
2. Push to GitHub to trigger a new Netlify deployment
3. Monitor the build logs to confirm successful deployment
4. Test your live site at https://dwansys.com/

## üéØ Expected Outcome
With these fixes applied, your Netlify deployment should now complete successfully, and your site should be accessible at your configured domains.
