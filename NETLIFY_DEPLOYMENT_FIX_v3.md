# üõ†Ô∏è Netlify Deployment Fix Summary (Version 3)

This document summarizes the fixes applied to resolve the Netlify deployment error related to configuration file parsing.

## üìã Issue Description
The Netlify deployment was failing with the following error:
```
Failed during stage 'Reading and parsing configuration files': 
When resolving config file /opt/build/repo/netlify.toml:
Base directory does not exist: /opt/build/repo/frontend
```

## üîç Root Cause Analysis
The issue was caused by a misconfiguration in how Netlify was set up to deploy the monorepo structure. The error indicates that:

1. Netlify was looking for a [frontend](file:///c:/Users/sathi/OneDrive/Desktop/Dwansys/frontend) directory at the root of the repository
2. The [netlify.toml](file://c:/Users/sathi/OneDrive/Desktop/Dwansys/frontend/netlify.toml) file was configured with a base directory setting that pointed to a non-existent path
3. The repository structure is a monorepo with separate [backend](file:///c:/Users/sathi/OneDrive/Desktop/Dwansys/backend) and [frontend](file:///c:/Users/sathi/OneDrive/Desktop/Dwansys/frontend) directories

## üõ†Ô∏è Fixes Applied

### 1. Created Root Configuration File
Created a new [netlify.toml](file://c:/Users/sathi/OneDrive/Desktop/Dwansys/netlify.toml) file at the root of the repository with the correct monorepo configuration:

```toml
[build]
  base = "frontend"
  command = "npm run build"
  publish = "frontend/dist"
```

This configuration tells Netlify to:
- Use the [frontend](file:///c:/Users/sathi/OneDrive/Desktop/Dwansys/frontend) directory as the base
- Run `npm run build` in that directory
- Publish the `frontend/dist` directory

### 2. Updated Frontend Configuration File
Modified the existing [frontend/netlify.toml](file://c:/Users/sathi/OneDrive/Desktop/Dwansys/frontend/netlify.toml) file to remove conflicting build configuration while preserving redirect and header settings.

## üìù Configuration Files Modified
1. **Root [netlify.toml](file://c:/Users/sathi/OneDrive/Desktop/Dwansys/netlify.toml)** - New file with monorepo configuration
2. **[frontend/netlify.toml](file://c:/Users/sathi/OneDrive/Desktop/Dwansys/frontend/netlify.toml)** - Updated to remove build configuration

## ‚úÖ Next Steps
1. Commit these changes to your repository
2. Push to GitHub to trigger a new Netlify deployment
3. Monitor the build logs to confirm successful deployment
4. Test your live site at https://dwansys.com/

## üéØ Expected Outcome
With these fixes applied, your Netlify deployment should now complete successfully, properly understanding the monorepo structure and deploying the frontend application correctly.
